    "One of the first major challenges in this competition is to properly preprocess the light curve time series data. Unlike many other \"well-behaved\" time series, the light curves here are not only irregular in terms of observation intervals, but also unsynchronised across different light bands. This makes applying many existing tools and techniques difficult because they often require a regular time series, preferably without missing values. Let us first look at what we have:"

    "* We may take all **mjd** values in the dataset and declare them 'valid observation timestamps', then construct a time series for each object and each passband that include all these observation timestamps, filling in NA if obseration is not available. Now that all objects and all passband have time series of the same length, they are comparable, and many time series analysis techniques can be applied as long as they can deal with missing values. One immediate drawback of this method is that none of the objects will have multiple passband data at a given timestamp, and there will be a huge number of NAs. The time series will also be really long due to the large number of possible timestamps. Also, we will face more issues when we want to build a model and apply it to new data, as the new timestamps will not match the timestamps in our current dataset. We can make a compromise by binning **mjd** and averaging the observations within a bin, and use all bins within the range of **mjd** as possible time steps in the time series. By doing so, we will be able to obtain a collection of time series that are equally spaced, not overwhemingly NA, and have the same length."

    "We kind of found a pattern here. If all colour bands agree in frequency, an object is likely to have periodic behaviours. When the colour bands have wildly different frequencies, the object is likely aperiodic. When most bands have very small frequencies (longer period than the observation window) and a few bands have larger detected frequencies, it is likely a burst event.\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that calculated periods alone cannot tell us the full picture, as there are plenty of objects in the dataset without clear periodic patterns. However, determining whether an object has a periodic pattern can be very important in determining the object class, and for objects that are actually periodic, the time series in phase space can tell us a lot more than in time space. Therefore, for a large portion of the dataset, conversion to phase space is actually a very powerful preprocessing step to use.\n",

So by just calculating a few frequency features and comparing these features between bands, we can already roughly tell them apart. We might still have trouble distinguishing between class 16 and 92, but with frequency divided out through phase-space conversion, we essentially have higher density data for these two classes to work with, and building a model on top of that should be easier."

    "Generally, we found that we are still able to use frequency analysis to find the most apparent periodic classes like 16 and 92, but we have to be much more lenient on how different bands agree with each other (sometimes only 3-4 bands will strongly agree in terms of frequency), and we might have to pay much more attention to the significance level of these frequencies. This could be evidence to support the case that DDF and non-DDF objects should be dealt with using different models, or at least treated differently in model."
